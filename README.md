This is the finance tracker app from the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course

This app is intended to be a Social Network among people interested in portfolios of securities, starting with stocks.

It is being developed in Rails 6 with ruby 2.6.5 so it should deliver some good performance while being a classic Rails web app.

I hope you all enjoy.
